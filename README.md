#What is this? 

Some old university projects for the POS (advanced operating systems) course.
There is obviously nothing *advanced* about **any** of this.

* `fork` is a basic launcher of other programs.
* `threadpool` runs a bunch of dummy tasks (sleep) on a thread pool.
* `shell` is an extremely simple and feature-free unix shell.
